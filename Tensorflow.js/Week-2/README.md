This week you created a basic handwriting classifier that was trained on the MNIST dataset. 
For your exercise, youâ€™ll do something very similar -- but working with the Fashion MNIST dataset. 
In this exercise, you will try to build and train a neural network that can classify the images in the Fashion MNIST dataset.
