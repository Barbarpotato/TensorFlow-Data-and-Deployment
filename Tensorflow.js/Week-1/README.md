This week you looked at doing a multi-class classification of Iris flowers, trained on CSV data. 
For your exercise, you’ll do something very similar -- but working with breast cancer data adapted from the  <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)" target="_blank">Wisconsin dataset.</a>
In this exercise, you will try to build and train a neural network that can predict from new data whether the diagnosis is malignant or benign. 
To train your network you will be using the given CSV data. The data has already been split for you into a training and a validation set. 
If you look at the CSV files, you will notice that the first column corresponds to the ‘diagnosis’ . 
The values in this column correspond to the diagnosis where a value of 1 indicates a malignant cancer, and a 0 indicates a benign one. 
Try to build a model that gives a very high accuracy on the test data.
